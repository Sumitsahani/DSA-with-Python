# Description
# Given two integers N, X. Find the value of the series: 1 + x + x*x + x*x*x + x*x*x*x +-------N the term WhereN is the no. of term,
# X contains the value of x.
# Note: If N <= 0 or X <= 0 print -1
# For Example
# â€¢ Give N = 3, X = 2
# We need to find the sum of first N=3 terms, having value of X=2 First 3 terms in Expression = 1 + x + x*x = 1+ 2+ 2*2 = 7 Answer is 7
